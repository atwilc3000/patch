The checkpatch helps us check the Linux kernel coding styles of the wilc3000
driver. Make sure the wilc3000 kernel driver complies to Linux kernel coding
styles by running checkpatch. 

Give a executable permission to checkpatch: 
chmod +x checkpatch

Then, check the directory recursively: 
./checkpatch

To redirect the outputs to the file, issue the following:
./checkpatch > checkpatchresults
